Comments (drapeza):
- no collaboration
- os functionality to get size did not work, thus size (content length) is arbitrary
- Got a few mimetype errors that didn't make sense. I was sure I was returning either text/html\n\r or text/css\n\r, but there were assertion errors that I was doing text/plain. I failed 1 freetest and 3 (test html, test hardcode, and test css) tests from not free tests because of this. I'm not sure why I'm getting this error because I put the right mimetypes (can be checked by printing the response in the handle method).
